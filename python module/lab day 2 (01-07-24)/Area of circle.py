""" * We define a function area that takes the radius of the circle as a parameter and computes the area using the formula (Ï€xrxr).
    *We prompt the user to enter the radius of the circle.
    *We call the area function with the user-provided radius to compute the area.
    *Finally, we print the calculated area, formatted to two decimal places for clarity.
