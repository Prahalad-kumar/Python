"""* We define a function calculate_area_of_rectangle that takes the length and width of the rectangle as parameters and computes the area using the formula length√ówidth.
   * We prompt the user to enter the length and width of the rectangle.
   * We call the area_of_rectangle function with the user-provided length and width to compute the area.
   * Finally, we print the calculated area of the rectangle, formatted to two decimal places for clarity."""
