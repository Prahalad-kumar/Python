"""* We define a function calculate_area_of_square that takes the side length of the square as a parameter and computes the area using the formula side√óside.
   * We prompt the user to enter the side length of the square.
   * We call the area_of_square function with the user-provided side length to compute the area.
   * Finally, we print the calculated area of the square, formatted to two decimal places for clarity."""
